Build me a fully functional interactive website for a project called Project Skyline – Cleveland. The website should display a digital version of the Cleveland skyline, inspired by the real buildings (Key Tower, Terminal Tower, 200 Public Square, etc.). Use a night-time aesthetic, deep navy backgrounds, and purple LED-style building lights, similar to how Cleveland lights its skyline for special events.

The website needs the following core features:

Digital Cleveland Skyline

Create several building elements of different heights that visually resemble Key Tower, Terminal Tower, 200 Public Square, and surrounding buildings.

Each building should be rendered in CSS as a rectangular structure with smooth edges.

Buildings should be “unlit” initially (darker color).

When illuminated, they should glow purple with a soft LED-like effect (glow / box-shadow).

Interactive “Light Your Mark” Function

Include a clean and modern form allowing the user to enter:

Their name

Their goal / ambition

When the user submits the form:

A random unlit building should illuminate with a glowing purple color.

A smooth animation should fade or glow the building from dark to lit.

Hovering over that building should display a tooltip containing the person’s name and goal.

Animations

Buildings should light up with:

a soft fade-in

a glow spread

Buttons and headers should have subtle hover animations.

Interface and Style

Dark-night city background (#070b14 or similar).

Neon purple accents (#a970ff).

Clean modern UI with a centered header:

Title: “Project Skyline – Cleveland”

Subtitle: “Light your mark on the skyline.”

A main button labeled “Add Your Light” that scrolls down smoothly to the form.

Technical Requirements

Use HTML/CSS/JavaScript only (no external frameworks needed).

Keep all code in one index.html file unless you choose to separate it.

Use CSS for skyline shapes and JS for interactivity.

Include comments in the code so I can modify it later.

Overall Goal of the Site
This website represents the concept of digitally “lighting up the skyline” to symbolize individual ambition, unity, and identity—every light on the skyline corresponds to a student’s personal goal.

Make the final page polished, responsive, and visually cinematic. It should feel like the early prototype of a real public-facing movement.
